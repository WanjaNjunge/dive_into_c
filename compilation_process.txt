Preprocesssor - Removes comments and includes header files in source code. Replaces macro name with code.

gcc -E source.c -o preprocessed_file.i -> runs only the preprocessor, and the preprocessed code will be saved in preprocessed_file.i.

gcc -S source.c -o assembly_file.s
 -> runs the preprocessor and compiler, producing assembly code. The assembly code will be saved in assembly_file.s.

gcc -c source.c -o object_file.o -> runs the preprocessor, compiler, and assembler, producing an object file. The object file will be saved in object_file.o.

gcc source.c -o executable_file
 -> completes the compilation process, including preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking. The final executable file will be saved in executable_file.
